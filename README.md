### Inspiration and project goals

Several years ago, the excellent hi-games.net was created by Ryan Heise. This site was a lot of fun, and many talented speedcubers were using it. Unfortunately though, the site did not age well. There were a number of problems and things that could be improved. Most notably was it's reliance on Java Applets, [which have been deprecated for years](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/moving-to-a-plugin-free-web). This deprecation effectively killed hi-games, and in the years since it has not been fixed.

That's where this project begins. With modern browsers we can make something better. Our goal is to make a speed cubing platform **that just works**, with no plugins or special permissions required. To achieve this, we're using native web technologies that are available in all browsers.

In addition to this, our goal is to be more than a site where you can simply record solves. There are so many features that we want to make. Our goal is to provide in depth stats for each user, host tournaments, provide memorization games to teach different algorithms, and much much more.
